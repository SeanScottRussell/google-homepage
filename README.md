This is my first GitHub project. I'm following the "Google homepage" project from The Odin Project.

Oaft! that was a lot harder than I expected.

Spent too long on positioning then realised it was not responsive, then spent too long trying to figure out flexbox but didn't even end up using it.

It's not a 100% recreation but happy with the result seeing as it's my first project.
